This little mod replaces to Songs in "Shantae and the Seven Sirens" with their respective Siivagunner rips. Enjoy!

## Usage

1. Download this mod by clicking the green button that reads "Code" on this page and choosing "Download as ZIP".
2. Just find the file "sound_music.bank" in your game folder (in my version from GOG the path was "Shantae and the Seven Sirens\Final_774057\data\sound_music.bank") rename it to something like "sound_musik.bank_original" and put the "sound_music.bank" file from this site in the same folder.
